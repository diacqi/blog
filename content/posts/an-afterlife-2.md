I wished to be able to swim faster, so I could explore the vast turquoise. I wanted to go underwater and
traverse what was beyond that barrier. I swam underwater and I could go significantly faster this time
almost as if my wish came true. I didn't feel that barrier this time around, it was illuminated enough
with the natural sunlight and the bioluminescent animals.

A frenzy of sharks nearby caught my eye, they were circling around a shoal of tuna and diving in to eat
as much of it as they could. The tuna tried to dodge the sharks as well as they could and in perfect
harmony. As much as they tried to evade them, some were eaten by the sharks sometimes. I swam
around the sharks, going close and moving away at times because instinctively I was afraid of them. But
I noticed that all this while, the sharks did not seem to have any predatory reaction to me being there.
One shark from among the herd which I hadn't noticed earlier gazed in my direction. “ They are not
interested in you.” the shark said in a somewhat hoarse yet familiar voice.

“ I liked you better when you were a whale” I said, realizing who the shark was, “ do you have a name?”
I asked, still admiring the sharks. I looked back at it expecting a reply and saw that it was back to the
form of a whale.

“I don't have a name.” it said, swimming towards these beautiful corals.
“Can I call you Alle?” I asked, following it to the corals.

I saw a turtle which was going to eat what I thought was a plastic cover but instead was a jellyfish. It
was a magical world underneath, the corals formed a rainbow of beautiful colors. There were so many
clownfish going in and out of the corals, butterfly fishes and so many more. They radiated so many
alluring hues and shades, the lights of the reef fluttering from one part to another. The more of the
depths I explored, the more breathtaking it all got.

“Alle, what exactly are you?” I asked, wondering how surreal all of this felt, how I could communicate
with her and how she could turn into a whale or a shark or more creatures I haven't seen her as.
“Consider me your guide to this realm” she said, “ to accompany you in your voyage of the ocean”.

As we had been traipsing along the ocean, an orca swam swiftly past me and I was pushed by its sheer
speed. There was a whole pod of orcas, the apex predators of all marine life. I couldn't see what fish
they were attacking because the pod had surrounded it but it seemed to be relatively big. The orcas
slapped the fish with their tails and pushed the fish to the surface with their sheer strength.

They coordinated by communicating in their own dialect with unique clicks and whistles. The varying
tones in their sounds triggered memories about captive cetaceans in me. After doing that a few times,
they flipped the fish onto its backside and that's when I noticed the fin and realized it was a shark. The
shark looked paralyzed once it was upside down, one of the orcas then grabbed the shark and swam
away and the pod followed. What I had seen then really proved that the orcas are the rightful apex
predators, the strategy used was so efficient and ideal for taking down a shark, almost as though they
had an idea of shark biology.

Maybe it was based on my mind, my love and fondness of the ocean and all its creatures was the
reason I was here. Among the so many things I had yearned for in my life, being one with the ocean
and being in the presence of majestic marine animals was on top of my list. But I could only assume
and ponder about things like these while aimlessly drifting across the boundless sea.
I had an idea of why it was the ocean but I didn't know what this place exactly was and how any of
what I had seen was possible. I had seen so much more here than I could have ever seen in my life, but
deep down I knew that I had only barely scratched the surface.

Some unusual sights, some blissful, all of which proved that we have only seen the tip of the iceberg,
and we cannot even fathom how much else the ocean truly has to offer.
Just aimlessly wandering the oceans is what Alle and I were doing. When we dove underwater to the
ocean bed we saw a whale carcass, except it wasn't just that. It was an ecosystem of its own because of
how large the skeleton is. It supported so many different deep sea organisms including squids of
different sizes, lobsters and so many more.

We continued swimming along and stumbled upon a rather unorthodox group of whales. What was
unusual was that they were sleeping, only vertically. All of them napping with their tails down like a
cluster of large columns floating in the water. After a few minutes, a few of them swam up to the
surface to breathe and swam back to the rest of the pod.

I then swam up to the surface, I looked up at the night sky and from the horizon rose a variety of
shades of light, slowly emerging and cloaking the night sky in colors ranging from various tones of blue,
green, pink and yellow. The Northern Lights, a shimmering expanse of illuminations in the darkness of
night, was a sight unsurpassed.
“Divine don’t you think?” Alle said, “This is your afterlife...”
