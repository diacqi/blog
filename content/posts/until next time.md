15 years spent together\
Throughout which you never left my side\
I am finally faced with the challenge of having to say goodbye\
Nothing could ever prepare me for this\
Here's to the times you never gave up on me

I couldn't be happier that you are going far in life\
But I just wish it wasn't so soon\
You picked me up when i fell\
You always lent a shoulder to cry on\
Here's to the times you always had my back
 
That meaningful look, that last moment of eye contact\
The seconds that our eyes stayed put, I'll never forget\
It felt like we had a thousand words to say\
And it was all encompassed in one gaze\
Here's to the time we get to see each other again
